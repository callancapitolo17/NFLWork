# MLB SGP Odds Scrapers

Fetch Same Game Parlay (SGP) odds from DraftKings and FanDuel for MLB correlated parlay edge finding. Both write to the same `mlb_sgp_odds` table so the scanner can shop combos across books.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd mlb_sgp
source venv/bin/activate
python scraper_draftkings_sgp.py           # all games, ~30s
python scraper_fanduel_sgp.py              # all games, ~1s
python scraper_draftkings_sgp.py --verbose
python scraper_fanduel_sgp.py --verbose
```

Requirements: `pip install curl_cffi duckdb` and the MLB pipeline must have run (`mlb_parlay_opportunities` table populated).

## How It Works

Pure REST API — no browser, no Chrome, no clicking. Uses `curl_cffi` with Chrome TLS impersonation to bypass DraftKings' Akamai bot protection.

```
DK League API          → event list (team names, event IDs)
DK Event Markets API   → main market number (Run Line ID)
DK SGP Parlays API     → ALL selection IDs (2MB response, main + alt lines)
Match Wagerzon total   → exact Over/Under selection ID
DK calculateBets       → correlation-adjusted SGP trueOdds
                       → mlb_sgp_odds table in DuckDB
```

## Singles scrapers

Two scrapers fetch single-leg odds for the MLB Dashboard bets tab,
replacing the Odds API for DraftKings and FanDuel pill data:

- `scraper_draftkings_singles.py` → writes `../dk_odds/dk.duckdb::mlb_odds`
- `scraper_fanduel_singles.py`    → writes `../fd_odds/fd.duckdb::mlb_odds`

Both use the shared client classes (`dk_client.py`, `fd_client.py`) — same
curl_cffi sessions, same Akamai bypass, same event-discovery code path as
the SGP scrapers. No second auth path, no duplicate rate-limit budget.

Output schema matches the wagerzon offshore convention (18-column wide
`mlb_odds` table). MLB.R consumes via `get_dk_odds()` / `get_fd_odds()`
(in `Tools.R`) → `scraper_to_canonical()` → `book_odds_by_book`.

### Coverage

| Period | DK | FD | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FG main (spread + total + ML)        | ✅ | ✅ | All 30 teams |
| FG alternate spreads                 | ✅ | ✅ | When DK/FD posts them |
| FG alternate totals                  | ✅ | ✅ | When DK/FD posts them |
| F5 main (spread + total + ML)        | ✅ | ✅ | F5 ML may be ✗ at DK |
| F5 alternate spreads / totals        | ✅ | ✅ | |
| F7 main (spread + total)             | ✅ | ✗ | FD doesn't post F7 |
| F7 alternate totals                  | ✅ | ✗ | |
| F3 (any market)                      | ✗ | ✗ | Neither book posts F3 spread/total/ML |

### Run timing

Orchestrated by `Answer Keys/run.py mlb` in the parallel scrape phase
(pre-MLB.R), gated by `.scrapers_done_mlb`. The SGP scrapers continue to
run post-MLB.R (they depend on `mlb_parlay_lines`) on a separate trigger.

### Refactor — SGP scrapers now share clients

`scraper_draftkings_sgp.py` and `scraper_fanduel_sgp.py` were refactored
to import event discovery from `dk_client` / `fd_client`. SGP combo logic
and `calculateBets` / `implyBets` pricing stay in the SGP files.
Behavior-preserving — regression tests in `tests/test_sgp_regression.py`
compare current sgp_decimal output against captured golden baselines
within 0.20 decimal-odds tolerance.

### Team-name canonicalization

DK returns abbreviated city prefixes (`"CLE Guardians"`, `"LA Angels"`,
`"STL Cardinals"`). `scraper_draftkings_singles.py` maintains a
30-entry `DK_TEAM_MAP` that translates DK names → canonical (Odds API
format) before writing rows. FD names already match canonical — no
mapping needed.

## DraftKings API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `sportsbook-nash.../league/leagueSubcategory/v1/markets` | None | List MLB events |
| `sportsbook-nash.../event/eventSubcategory/v1/markets` | None | Main market IDs per game |
| `sportsbook-nash.../parlays/v1/sgp/events/{id}` | curl_cffi | **All selection IDs** (2MB response) |
| `gaming-us-nj.../api/wager/v1/calculateBets` | curl_cffi | **SGP pricing** (POST, returns trueOdds) |
| `sportsbook-nash.../sgp/dkusnj/sportsdata/v2/sgp` | Full Akamai | SGP pricing (DK frontend only — **inaccessible** via REST) |

### Why curl_cffi?

DraftKings uses Akamai Bot Manager. Plain `requests` gets blocked by TLS fingerprinting. `curl_cffi` impersonates Chrome's TLS signature, which is enough to bypass Akamai on `calculateBets` and `parlays/v1/sgp/events`. The `sportsdata/v2/sgp` endpoint has stricter protection and is inaccessible — that's why we use `calculateBets` instead.

**Things that DON'T work:** direct HTTP requests, page.evaluate(fetch()), cookie transfer from browser to requests, Playwright stealth plugins. All tested extensively.

## Selection ID Format

```
Spread: 0HC{market_num}{N|P}{line*100}_{suffix}
Total:  0OU{market_num}{O|U}{line*100}_{suffix}

Examples:
  0HC84191361N150_1   → Home team -1.5, market 84191361, suffix _1
  0HC84191361P150_3   → Away team +1.5, market 84191361, suffix _3
  0OU84203528O750_1   → Over 7.5, alt market 84203528, suffix _1
  0OU84203528U750_3   → Under 7.5, alt market 84203528, suffix _3
```

- **Suffix** (`_1` vs `_3`) varies per game — can't predict, must read from SGP parlays data
- **N** = negative spread (favorite), **P** = positive spread (underdog)
- **Market number** comes from market ID (e.g., `2_84191361` → `84191361`)
- Main market and alt market have **different** market numbers

## DK Market Structure

- **Main market** (subcategory 4519): Run Line (±1.5) + one Total (DK's main line) + Moneyline
- **Alt market**: Alt spreads (±1.0, ±2.5, etc.) + alt totals (every 0.5 from 5.0 to 13.0+)
- Both appear in the SGP parlays response
- **Game line markets** have BOTH spread AND total selections — inning/prop markets have only one. The scraper uses this to filter out non-game markets.

## Known DK Restrictions

### Cross-Market Blocking Near Main Line
DK won't combine the main run line with alt totals within ±0.5 of their main total. Example: if DK's main total is O/U 8.5, you can SGP with O7.5 or O9.5, but NOT O8.0 or O9.0. This is confirmed on DK's website too ("Sorry, your picks cannot be parlayed"). The scraper returns no price for these games rather than using a different total.

### Transient Rejections
Some games temporarily return `SelectionsCannotBeCombined` then work minutes later. The scraper retries once after a 2-second delay.

### SelectionClosed
Games near first pitch may close SGP pricing entirely.

## SGP Scraping Playbook (for adding new books)

Lessons learned from building DK and FD scrapers. Use this when expanding to new sites (BetMGM, Caesars, ESPN BET, etc.).

### The 3 endpoints you need to find

Every book has these, just named differently:

| What | DK | FD | What to look for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Event listing** | `league/.../v1/markets` | `scan/.../facet/.../search` | Returns today's games with event IDs + team names |
| **Market catalog** | `parlays/v1/sgp/events/{id}` | `sbapi/event-page?eventId=X&tab=same-game-parlay-` | Returns ALL selection IDs (main + alt) for one game |
| **SGP pricing** | `wager/v1/calculateBets` | `fixedodds/transactional/v1/implyBets` | POST with 2 selection IDs, returns correlated price |

### Recon process

1. Open the book in Chrome with DevTools → Network tab
2. Build a 2-leg SGP manually (spread + total)
3. Capture every network request during "add 2nd leg" — the SGP pricing call fires here
4. **Capture request HEADERS, not just URLs.** Missing headers was a multi-hour debugging session on FD. The API returned 200 with degraded data (singles only) instead of an error.
5. Try replaying the call with `curl_cffi` → if it works, you're done. If 400/403, check for missing headers or bot protection tokens.

### Common gotchas

**Silent degradation > explicit errors.** FD returns 200 with single-leg prices when headers are wrong, instead of 403. DK returns 422 with a clear error code. Assume the worst: always verify the response contains the SGP combined entry, not just a 200 status.

**Alt markets may hide behind a different tab/category.** FD's default event-page returns 3-5 markets. Adding `&tab=same-game-parlay-` returns 156+. Always check if there's a tab/category parameter that unlocks more markets.

**Selection ID formats vary wildly.** DK encodes market number + sign + line + suffix into strings like `0HC84191361N150_1`. FD uses plain integer `selectionId` tied to a `marketId`. Don't assume one format.

**Team disambiguation in alt spread markets.** Alt run line markets list BOTH teams at each line (e.g., "Reds -1.5" AND "Marlins -1.5"). You need to match runner team names against known home/away to avoid pricing the wrong team's spread. Key by `("home", line)` / `("away", line)`, not by handicap sign.

**Live games return adjusted handicaps.** A game in progress shows Run Line at +2.5/-2.5 instead of ±1.5. Filter events with `openDate < now` before scraping. Two events can exist for the same matchup (live + tomorrow's pre-game).

**Doubleheaders use hour-level matching.** Both scrapers dedupe by `(home, away, start_hour)` so two pre-game events for the same matchup (doubleheader) are preserved as separate events. The R staging table (`mlb_parlay_lines`) carries `commence_time` from the Odds API, and `match_events()` in each scraper compares the UTC hour of the DK/FD event against the stored `commence_time` hour to assign the correct `game_id`. Typical doubleheader slots (noon + 7 PM ET) are ~5 hours apart in UTC, so hour-level matching is sufficient.

**PerimeterX / bot protection tokens.** Some books require a `x-px-context` or similar token that's set by JavaScript on page load. `curl_cffi` impersonation alone isn't enough — you need the token too. These tokens are semi-persistent (days/weeks) but eventually rotate. Hardcode for v1, add auto-refresh later if needed.

### Vig measurement

For any book, compute vig from the 4 mutually-exclusive combos per game:

```
vig = sum(1/D for all 4 combos: HomeSpread+Over, HomeSpread+Under, AwaySpread+Over, AwaySpread+Under)
```

This sum exceeds 1.0 by the book's vig charge. Measured values:
- **DK:** stable ~1.125 (12.5% vig), consistent across time-to-game
- **FD:** bimodal — ~1.13 for games >21h out, ~1.22 for games <16h out

**Don't hardcode a single vig constant** when the book's vig varies. Use per-game devigging: divide each combo's implied prob by the per-game sum. Falls back to a constant when <4 combos are available.

**FG and F5 are separate partitions.** Never sum across both periods — that doubles the measured vig. Group by `(game_id, period)`.

### Line matching

The scraper first attempts exact-line matching: Wagerzon's exact spread and total lines must exist in the book's selection-ID dictionary, and that pair gets priced via `calculateBets` / `implyBets` / equivalent.

**Integer-line fallback.** When Wagerzon posts an SGP at an integer total line (e.g., FG Over 8, F5 Over 4) that the book doesn't quote directly, the scraper falls back to interpolating from the two adjacent half-point alts (X-0.5 and X+0.5). The integer-line derivation is implemented in `mlb_sgp/integer_line_derivation.py`. See "Integer-Line Derivation" below.

**No-fallback behavior.** If the book doesn't have either adjacent half-point alt, or any of the 4 bounds checks fails on the derived prices, the game's period is skipped for that book — same graceful degradation as today's "WZ line not found" path. The R blender treats the book as missing for that game.

### Integer-Line Derivation

When an integer total line `X` is missing, the scraper issues 8 SGP pricing calls (4 combos × 2 alts at `X − 0.5` and `X + 0.5`), per-alt-devigs each set, and derives joint fair probabilities at the integer line:

```
Δ_total      = (devig_HomeOver_lo − devig_HomeOver_hi)
             + (devig_AwayOver_lo − devig_AwayOver_hi)
             = P(T = X)   (the joint marginal push mass)

fair_prob_X  = devig_hi_combo / (1 − Δ_total)   for Over combos
             = devig_lo_combo / (1 − Δ_total)   for Under combos
```

Interpretation: the conditional joint probability "this combo wins outright, given the bet doesn't push." Books refund pushed legs regardless of spread side, so the conditioning matches real-world settlement. Pure-joint computation — no singles totals market accessed.

**Underlying principle:** Breeden & Litzenberger (1978) showed in options markets that adjacent strike prices implicitly carry the probability mass of the in-between outcome (the second derivative of call prices w.r.t. strike). This is the discrete sports analog: the difference between adjacent half-point alt SGPs gives us the implied joint integer-mass at `X`. Half-point pricing calculators (Sportsbook Review, Bookmakers Review, Unabated) apply the same skeleton in singles markets; we extend it to two-leg correlated parlays.

The derived rows are written with `source = '<book>_interpolated'` so post-hoc analysis can compare realized P&L on interpolated vs directly-priced rows.

**Bounds checks** (config constants in `integer_line_derivation.py`):

| # | Check | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Per-alt vig sum | `[1.05, 1.30]` |
| 2 | `Δ_total` plausibility | `[0.03, 0.18]` |
| 3 | Sum of 4 derived fair_probs | `[0.97, 1.03]` |
| 4 | Per-combo bounds | `(0, 1)` strict |

The push-mass cross-consistency check (initially shipped as bounds check #2) was removed after production data showed it tripping on real-world FD vig asymmetry (~10-15% disagreement is normal market noise, not data corruption). The two push-mass derivations are still computed and averaged for robustness.

On any failure: the game's period is skipped for that book, structured WARN logged with inputs and the violated check.

**Manual integration test:** `/Users/callancapitolo/NFLWork/mlb_sgp/venv/bin/python -m mlb_sgp.tests.test_integration_integer_line` — verifies a recent slate has interpolated rows with sum-to-one invariant holding. Exit 0=pass, 1=fail, 2=inconclusive (no integer-line games).

### Integration into the R scanner

New books write to `mlb_sgp_odds` with their own `bookmaker` and `source` values. The R scanner (`mlb_correlated_parlay.R`) reads all books, computes per-game vig for each, and blends their devigged fair probs equally with the model. Adding a third book requires:

1. Add `'newbook_direct'` to the `WHERE source IN (...)` query
2. Add a `NEWBOOK_SGP_VIG_DEFAULT` fallback constant
3. Add a `nb_vig_lookup` table (same pattern as DK/FD)
4. Add the `nb_row` / `nb_fair_prob` block in the per-combo loop (copy DK or FD block)
5. Optionally add `nb_fair_prob` to the output tibble

The blend automatically scales: `mean(model, dk, fd, nb)` when all present, falls back gracefully when books are missing.

## Concurrency & Logs

The four SGP scrapers (DK, FD, ProphetX, Novig) are launched in parallel by
`Answer Keys/mlb_correlated_parlay.R` via `parallel::mclapply` (4 forked R
workers, one per scraper). Wall-clock time of the SGP refresh block is the
*max* of the four scrape times rather than the sum.

**Per-scraper logs:** stdout + stderr from each scraper are captured to
`mlb_sgp/logs/<scraper>.log` (overwritten each run, gitignored). The
orchestrator also prints a one-line summary per scraper (elapsed seconds,
exit code, log path) plus an overall wall-clock line — check the R console
output to see which book is the slowest on a given run.

**DuckDB write contention:** All four scrapers write to `Answer Keys/mlb_mm.duckdb`,
which DuckDB only allows one writer to open at a time. `db.py` wraps every
write `connect()` call in `_connect_with_retry()` (exponential backoff +
jitter, up to 10 attempts) so transient lock collisions between scrapers are
invisible to callers. Read connections are not retried (DuckDB allows
unlimited concurrent readers). Note: the trifecta scraper (`scraper_draftkings_trifecta.py`) is separate — it writes `mlb_trifecta_sgp_odds` to `Answer Keys/mlb.duckdb`.

---

## FanDuel Scraper

`scraper_fanduel_sgp.py` mirrors the DK scraper but is much simpler since FD's selection IDs are plain integers tied to marketIds (no DK-style `0HC...` decoding) and FD doesn't lock its pricing endpoint behind Akamai.

### How it works

```
FD scan API           → MLB events list (competitionId 11196870)
canonical_match       → resolve FD team names to internal game_ids
FD event-page API     → all SGP-eligible runners (main + alt, FG + F5)
                        via &tab=same-game-parlay- (156+ markets)
Match Wagerzon lines  → exact spread + total lookup
FD implyBets API      → POST each combo, parse isSGM=true entry
                      → mlb_sgp_odds (bookmaker='fanduel')
```

### Required headers

FD's API silently strips the SGP combination from `implyBets` responses (returning only single-leg prices) if any of these are missing:

| Header | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x-application` | `FhMFpcPWXMeyZxOx` | FD's API key, also passed as `?_ak=` query param |
| `x-sportsbook-region` | `NJ` | Geo header. The `nj.` hostnames are FD's backend routing — works from any state, no VPN required. |
| `x-px-context` | `_pxvid=...;pxcts=...;` | PerimeterX visitor token. Hardcoded in the scraper; long-lived but rotates eventually. |

### Combo logic

Per game, 4 combos × 2 periods (FG + F5) = up to 8 prices. Matches Wagerzon's exact lines:

- Home Spread + Over / Under
- Away Spread + Over / Under
- F5 Home Spread + Over / Under
- F5 Away Spread + Over / Under

**Exact line matching only.** The scraper fetches main + alt spreads and totals from FD's SGP tab, then looks up the exact Wagerzon spread and total. If FD doesn't have the precise line, that game is skipped (no approximate matching). Alt spreads (e.g., ±2.5, ±3.5) are resolved by matching runner team names against the event's home/away teams.

### When the PerimeterX token expires

If FD starts returning 400s with empty bodies, or `implyBets` stops returning the `isSGM=true` entry, the `x-px-context` token has rotated. To refresh:

1. Open `sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/mlb` in Chrome with DevTools open
2. Find any `event-page` request in the Network tab
3. Copy the `x-px-context` request header
4. Paste into `FD_PX_CONTEXT` constant in `scraper_fanduel_sgp.py`

A future v2 may bootstrap this automatically via headless Chrome.

### FD-specific lessons learned

- **Event name format:** `"Away Team (P Pitcher) @ Home Team (P Pitcher)"` — strip the pitcher parens before team matching.
- **`nj.` hostnames are NOT geo-restricted.** `sib.nj.sportsbook.fanduel.com` works from California with no VPN. The `nj` prefix is FD's backend routing, not a geo gate.
- **`implyBets` returns 3 entries for a 2-leg combo:** 2 `SINGLE` (one per leg, `isSGM=false`) and 1 `DOUBLE` (`isSGM=true` — this is the SGP price). Parse `winAvgOdds.trueOdds.decimalOdds.decimalOdds` for the decimal value.
- **FD's SGP vig is bimodal by time-to-game:** ~13% for games >21h out, ~21% for games <16h out. The step change happens around 16-21h before first pitch — possibly tied to lineup posting windows.
- **Alt total runner names use parens:** `"Over (8.5)"`, `"Under (7.5)"`. Main total runners are just `"Over"` / `"Under"` with the line in the `handicap` field.
- **Alt spread runner names embed the team:** `"Cincinnati Reds +3.5"`. The `handicap` field is 0 for alts. Parse team name + signed line from the string, match team to home/away.
- **F5 totals at integer values (e.g., 5.0) trigger interpolation.** FD's F5 alt totals jump in 1.0 increments (2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5...). When Wagerzon has F5 total 5.0, FD's exact-line lookup misses → the integer-line fallback kicks in, using FD's F5 alts at 4.5 and 5.5. See "Integer-Line Derivation" above.
- **2026-05-13:** Fixed alt-spread bucket key in `scraper_fanduel_singles.py` — was `abs(effective_line)` which collapsed opposite-direction same-magnitude lines (e.g. KC -2.5 and KC +2.5) into one row. Now buckets by signed home-team line so both directions persist. Verified event 35600618 went 7 → 14 alt-spread rows. See `docs/superpowers/research/2026-05-13-fd-recon-findings.md`.

## Library architecture (line-source pivot, 2026-05-13)

The SGP scrapers were refactored into a 3-layer stack so the same pricing code
can serve both the MLB dashboard (writes to `mlb_mm.duckdb`) and the Kalshi
MLB RFQ bot (writes to a sibling `kalshi_mlb_rfq_market.duckdb`).

- **Per-book HTTP clients** — pure transport, no domain logic:
  - `dk_client.py` — DK leagues / event-markets / parlays / `calculateBets`
  - `fd_client.py` — FD scan / event-page / `implyBets`
  - `prophetx_client.py` — ProphetX RFQ endpoint
  - `novig_client.py` — Novig anonymous `/unauthenticated` SGP endpoint
- **Per-book SGP orchestrators** — `price_sgps(targets) -> List[PricedRow]`:
  - `draftkings.py`, `fanduel.py`, `prophetx.py`, `novig.py`
  - Each loads its client, walks the target `(game_id, period, spread_line, total_line)` tuples, prices all 4 combos per tuple, devigs, returns `PricedRow`s.
- **Thin scraper shims** — `scraper_{book}_sgp.py`:
  - Load target lines via `_shared.load_target_lines()`
  - Call the book's `price_sgps()`
  - Upsert via `_shared.upsert_priced_rows()`
  - No pricing logic — just I/O glue.

**Target-line tables.** Two sources, same shape:
- `mlb_parlay_lines` in `mlb_mm.duckdb` — Wagerzon-derived; one target line per game/period; used by the dashboard pipeline.
- `mlb_target_lines` in the bot's sibling market DB — Kalshi MVE-derived; many target lines per game (every `(spread, total)` tuple Kalshi lists); used by the bot's SGP cadence loop.

`load_target_lines()` reads whichever table exists in the connected DB.

**Env overrides** (consumed by every scraper shim and `_shared.py`):
- `MLB_SGP_DB_PATH` — full path to the DuckDB the scraper should read targets from and write priced rows back to. Defaults to `Answer Keys/mlb_mm.duckdb`. The bot sets it to its sibling market DB so dashboard data is never touched.
- `MLB_SGP_PERIODS` — comma-separated list of periods to price (`FG`, `F5`, `F7`). Defaults to all. The bot sets `FG` only.

**Output schema.** `mlb_sgp_odds` now carries `spread_line` and `total_line` columns alongside `combo`, so multi-line target lines from Kalshi can be priced and dedupe-merged without collision (the dashboard pipeline writes a single line per game/period, the bot writes many).

## Troubleshooting

**"No mlb_parlay_opportunities table"** — Run the MLB pipeline first (`cd "Answer Keys" && python run.py --sport mlb`).

**All games return "no price"** — curl_cffi session may have expired. The scraper auto-reinits after 3 consecutive failures, but if all games fail, try running again.
