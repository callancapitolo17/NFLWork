# ============================
# NCAA Tournament Simulator
# ============================
# This script:
# 1. Acquires bracket data (team names, seeds, regions, and play-in flag).
# 2. Acquires power ratings from three sources:
#    - ESPNâ€™s BPI (scraped live)
#    - KenPom ratings (from a local CSV file)
#    - PoolGenius ratings (from a local CSV file)
# 3. Combines these ratings into a composite rating (weighted average).
# 4. Merges the composite ratings with the bracket data.
# 5. Runs a Monte Carlo simulation of the tournament,
#    including simulating the First Four (play-in) games.
#
